        <p>Just like the dip that inspired it, the Hot Cowgirl Casserole delivers a kick of heat
             thats “dangerously delicious.” This bold, flavor-packed dinner brings together all your
              favorite Southwest-inspired ingredients—black beans, fire-roasted corn, green chiles,
               and melty Monterey Jack cheese—into one creamy, cheesy, and comforting casserole.
               Perfect for cozy dinners or feeding a hungry crowd, this casserole is as satisfying 
               as it is simple to make. Plus, it celebrates the spirit of cowgirls: bold, fun, 
               and full of flavor. “Spicy!” said recipe taster Julia Levy. 
               “Makes me feel like a cowgirl!”
