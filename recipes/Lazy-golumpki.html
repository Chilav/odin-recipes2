            <li>Boil cabbage in a stockpot until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix salt, parsley, onion powder, and black pepper into ground beef.

            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 45 minutes.</li>
